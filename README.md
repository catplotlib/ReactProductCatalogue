# Catalogue Display

The project at hand is a demo web application that allows users to display and filter products based on their categories. This is accomplished using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The application provides a clean and intuitive interface that allows users to browse products easily. The categories are displayed prominently, and users can quickly filter products by selecting a specific category. The application also provides a search bar, allowing users to search for products by name or description.

One notable feature of the application is its use of the Wired Elements CSS framework. This framework provides a hand-drawn, sketchy effect to the user interface, giving it a unique and eye-catching look. The Wired Elements framework includes a collection of pre-built UI components, including buttons, input fields, and other elements, each with a hand-drawn aesthetic.

React is used to create and manage these UI components, allowing for efficient and responsive updates to the user interface as users interact with the application. React also provides tools for managing application state, allowing the application to keep track of which products are currently displayed and which categories are selected.

Overall, this demo web application showcases the power and flexibility of React, as well as the creative possibilities offered by the Wired Elements CSS framework. It provides an engaging and interactive user experience that allows users to quickly find and browse products in a visually appealing and memorable way.
